NOTES:
Submission says we are required to include a report so mine is in this file.
My shell can operate with multiple pipes.


FILES:
mshell.c - All the code for the project except for the parser.  
		   All function comments are in here too.

mshell.h - Function prototypes and #include statements

lex.c    - Flex parser provided on the forum

makefile - Nothing to say, its a makefile


COMPILATION AND RUN:
A simple make will compile everything.
command:
make

The executable will be called msh.
command:
./msh


ALGORITHM:

get line from terminal
if line is NULL:
	repeat from top
if line is "exit":
	exit
if line is "arg":
	call arg()
	repeat from top
if line is "add":
	call add()
	repeat from top
check for input redirection
check for output redirection
count pipes
check for &
run command:
	if no pipes:
		fork()
		CHILD:
			apply input and/or output redirection
			execvp the command
			exit
		PARENT:
			if & was not found:
				wait for child
	if pipes:
		set up pipes
		get next command
		loop until out of commands:
			fork()
			CHILD:
				apply input and/or output redirection
				if not last command:
					pipe output
				if not first command:
