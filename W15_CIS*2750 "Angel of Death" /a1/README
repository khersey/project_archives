********** COMPILE AND RUN ***********
just type: make (or make all)
and add "libpm.a" as a parameter when compiling to use the library.

"make clean" will remove libpm.a and *.o


********** NOTES ***********
All function comments are in the .c files.
I only used one header file to make my life easier.
ParameterManager.c contains all the required functions.
