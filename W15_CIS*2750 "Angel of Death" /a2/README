********** COMPILE AND RUN ***********
compile
in terminal type: make

run
in terminal type: java dialogc.Dialogc


********** NOTES ***********
Something might go wrong if you don't run the program from the a2 directory.
Commenting in the Java code is a little sparse, and doesnt contain JavaDoc tags.
I couldn't get the Run part of Compile and Run to work, but I'm pretty sure 
it was because I was not providing the correct Java Run Time arguments, not the 
program itself as I could get my source files to compile, and the code for 
compiling and runing is almost identical.
