********** COMPILE AND RUN ***********
compile commands:
make
make dialogc    (compile java files)
make libpm      (compile c files)
make yadc       (compile lex/yacc files)
make clean      (removes: c_src/*.o, c_src/*.so, dialogc/*.class, yadc_src/y.*, yadc_src/lex.yy.c, yadc_src/yadc)

run commands:
java dialogc.Dialogc


********** YADC **********
run commands:
./yadc [input file] 
or
./yadc [input file] [working directory]
or
./yadc < [input file]

Both parameters are optional.  
If one parameter is passed it will be interpretted as an input file.
If a second parameter is also passed it will be interpretted as the working directory.
You can use file redirection if you want, but the compiler will act as though your inputfile name was NameNotSpecied.config.
In the case: ./yadc fileA.config < fileB.config
    fileA.config would be used as the input file.

For Example the Command:
./yadc bigProject.config folder1/folder2/folder3

Would create directory structure:
.folder1/folder2/folder3/bigProject/

Would create files:
.folder1/folder2/folder3/bigProject/bigProject.java
.folder1/folder2/folder3/bigProject/bigProjectFieldEdit.java
.folder1/folder2/folder3/bigProject/IllegalFieldValueException.java


********** NOTES ***********
My makefile is designed to recognize if it is being run on OS X, Ubuntu or Other.
If it gives you any crap, 
Replace:
---------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE = $(shell awk -F= '/^NAME/{print $2}' /etc/os-release)


ifeq ($(PLATFORM) , Darwin)
    JNI = JNI_mac
else
    ifeq ($(RELEASE), NAME="Ubuntu")
        JNI = JNI_ubuntu
    else
        JNI = JNI_lab
    endif
endif
---------------------------------------------------------------

With:
JNI = JNI_lab

and hopefully that will fix it.
