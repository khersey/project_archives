Goals of this Assignment:
The goal of this assignment is to create a Day Planner program implemented in Java to keep track
of different activties.  All activities will be categorized as Home, School or Other.  This program
will allow the user to add new activities to one of these categories, and also to search through 
these categories to find existing activites.  Searches can be done using a combination of keywords
found in the title, time range, and activity type. 


*****************************************************************************************************
Assumptions and Limitations:
We are assuming the user will have no more than 64 events per category.  If the user tries to add 
more than 64 events to a category they will be alerted that the category is full.  Time range
search must use a range, the user cannot simply search for anything after a certain start time, or
before a certain end time.  


*****************************************************************************************************
How to Build and Test:
Open up the root directory of the source code as a Project in Netbeans.
Click the "Run Project" button
or
Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you extracted the .tar.gz
into terminal type in command: ant
after compilation navigate to /build/classes
into terminal type in command: java DayPlanner

At the main menu type in 'add'
Add a new activity to a list of your choice.
At the main menu again type in 'search' or 's'
Search for your new activity using which ever fields you want to
If you use search correctly it should find your activity


*****************************************************************************************************
Test Plan:
Command loop conditions
the user's input could be:
-upper case
-lower case
-mixed case
-first letter of word
-the wrong word

Add conditions:
-the user is adding to an array that is empty
-the user is adding to an array that is not empty and not full
-the user is adding to an array that is full
-the user provides a start date that is before the end date
-the user provides a start date that is equal to the end date
-the user provides a start date that is after the end date

New Date conditions:
-months must fall within range 1-12
-days must fall within range 1-31
-hours must fall within range 0-23
-minutes must fall within range 0-59

Search conditions:
All searches will be a combination of:
-the user is searching through one of the lists
-the user is searching through all of the lists
and
-the user is searching with keywords
-the user is searching without keywords
and
-the user is searching with a time range
-the user is searching without a time range
position within the list does not influence the way search results occur in this program.

Search results:
-the search returned one result
-the search returned multiple results
-the search returned no results

Search keywords:
-all the keywords exist in the title exactly
-all the keywords exist in the title not exactly (eg keyword = 'fred' title = 'freddy')
-all the keywords do not exist in the title
-some keywords exist in the title
-no keywords are specified

Search dates:
-the event ends inside the range
-the event starts inside the range
-the event starts and ends inside the range
-date search is not used


*****************************************************************************************************
Possible Improvements:
The ability to remove an activity from an array.
Activites could be listed using a more flexible data structure than an array allowing for an unlimited
amount of activies in a list.
The ability to search for an other activity by location. 
The ability to add repeating events.
The ability to display one or more lists, and/or search results visually, maybe on a calendar.
